                Preskriptor's intent is to make it easier for you to handle the writing and distribution of prescriptions, as well as maintain a basic patient record. While you write prescriptions, the app can autocomplete many fields, and provide suggestions based on what you type. 
                Letterheads, patient tests, and drug information can be modified and updated via the admin section.                

            </p>
            <p style="font-size:larger;">
                The app automatically picks up patient information from a submitted prescription and creates or updates the corresponding patient records in a database. 
                These records can be viewed any time, and will always reflect the information in the latest prescription written for that patient.
